Rule distances: 
[[0.59375]]


Optimal Rule Assignment: 
[0]


We matched rule:
terminatedAt(=(highSpeedNearCoast(Vessel),true),T) :- 
	happensAt(velocity(Vessel,Speed),T),
	-(holdsAt(=(nearCoast(Vessel),true),T)).

which has the distance array: [0.59375]

with the following rule: 
terminatedAt(=(highSpeedNearCoast(Vessel),true),T) :- 
	happensAt(end(=(withinArea(Vessel,nearCoast),true)),T).

Their distance is: 0.59375



Sum of distances for optimal rule assignment: 
0.59375
Distance between event descriptions: 
0.59375
Event Description Similarity: 
0.40625
