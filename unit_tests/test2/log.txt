Optimal Rule Assignment: 
[0]


We matched rule:
initiatedAt(=(withinArea(Vessel,AreaType),true),T) :- 
	happensAt(entersArea(Vessel,AreaID),T),
	areaType(AreaID,AreaType).

which has the distance array: [0.]

with the following rule: 
initiatedAt(=(withinArea(Vessel,AreaType),true),T) :- 
	happensAt(entersArea(Vessel,Area),T),
	areaType(Area,AreaType).

Their distance is: 0.0



Sum of distances for optimal rule assignment:
