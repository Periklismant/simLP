# simLP: A Similarity Metric for Logic Programs

A Python program that calculates the syntactic similarity between two Prolog programs. This similarity metric has been employed in the following paper, which has been accepted at EDBT 2025.

- Kouvaras A., Mantenoglou P., Artikis A., [Generating Activity Definitions with Large Language Models](https://openproceedings.org/2025/conf/edbt/paper-295.pdf)

In this work, we used our metric to assess the quality of LLM-generated logic programs, specifying composite activity definitions in the language of the composite activity recognition framework [RTEC](https://github.com/aartikis/rtec), by comparing them with hand-crafted ones.
