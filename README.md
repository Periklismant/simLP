# simLP: A Similarity Metric for Logic Programs

A Python program that calculates the syntactic similarity between two Prolog programs. This similarity metric has been employed in the following paper, which is under review at EDBT 2025.

- Kouvaras A., Mantenoglou P., Artikis A., Generating Activity Definitions with Large Language Models.

There, the task was to compare logic programs specifying composite activity definitions in the language of the Run-Time Event Calculus ([RTEC](https://github.com/aartikis/rtec)), i.e., a formal composite activity recognition framework written in Prolog.
