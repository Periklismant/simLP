-The 'similarity comparison' file is the ground truth for syntactic similarity. This file does not include the rules used as examples in the initial prompts.
-The 'predictive accuracy' file is the ground truth for the f1-score computation. This file includes the rules that were omitted for the ;similarity comparison' file.
