\section{Method}\label{sec:method}

Our goal is to construct \rtec\ event descriptions with the use of LLMs.
%
We compare these event descriptions with hand-crafted event descriptions in \rtec, constructed by domain experts, using a similarity metric.
%
We employed a similarity metric for event descriptions, which is an extension of the similarity metric for collections of ground atoms used in~\cite{DBLP:journals/ml/MichelioudakisA19}
%
We define the simil

Our goal is to evaluate the event description

\begin{definition}[Ground Atom Distance]\label{def:ground_atom_dist}

%
\qeddef
%
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Rule Distance]\label{def:rule_dist}

%
\qeddef
%
\end{definition}

Based on Definition \ref{def:rule_dist}, we handle non-ground atoms as follows... 

\begin{definition}[Event Description Distance]\label{def:ed_dist}

%
\qeddef
%
\end{definition}

The similarity of two event descriptions with distance $d$ is $1\minus d$.
