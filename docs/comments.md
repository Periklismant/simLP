1. The rules generated by LLMs sometimes do not include the definitions of building block FVPs. Should we involve this in our distance function? This is implicitly punished based on the absence of a rule. 

2. How to correctly deal with the distance between variables? Variables with the same name across different rules do not necessarily have the same meaning. Also, variable renaming should not affect the result.

To tackle the second point, I computed the routes to its variable in a rule, i.e., the sequence of nested atoms until reaching the variable, and compare these routes instead of variable names.
For the comparison, I am taking into account the names of the predicates in the routes and the position of the variable in each corresponding predicate.
If the routes match exactly, then the distance between the variables is 0. Otherwise, it is 1.

Should I add predicate arity in the comparison?
    Probably not. Consider the comparison of the following rules:

    p(X, a):-
        q(b),
        r(c, X).

    q(b):-
        p(X, a),
        r(c, X).

    If X are considered different across the two rules, then the distance is 1/3*(1+1/4+1).
    Otherwise, the distance is 1/3(1+0+1).

    X in p(X, a) has the same meaning regardless of the position of p(X,a) in the rule. So, we should consider the Xs the same.
